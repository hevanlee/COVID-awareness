# COVID-kids
Project created by Jamie Clarisse Domingo, Kirsten Belle Tai, Evan Lee

## Description
Covid-Kids is a project to increase primary school children's awareness of COVID-19 and the safe practices surrounding it. This project was inspired by the observation that many young children are naturally averse to their parents wearing face masks and would always try to remove it from their face. Further investigation found that primary school children a few years older were also unaware of practices that needed to be taken to keep themselves and their peers safe. This project addresses these issues through fun activities and videos for the children and links to more information and resources for the adults, including a regularly updated table of current national hotspots scraped from Queensland Government website.
