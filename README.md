# COVID-kids
Project created by Jamie Clarisse Domingo, Kirsten Belle Tai, Evan Lee

## Description
A project to increase awareness of COVID-19 and safe practices targeted at primary school children. This project was inspired by the observation that many young children
are naturally averse to their parents wearing face masks and would always try to remove it from their face. Further investigation found that primary school children a few years older
were also unaware of practices that needed to be taken to keep themselves and their peers safe. This project addresses these issues through fun activities and videos for the children and links
to more information and resources for the adults, including a regularly updated table of current national hotspots scraped from Queensland Government website.
